# ICalendar
.Net module to parse and create icalendar files.

We are really sorry because we don't have any documentation about the library. We are working on a CalDAV server for our thesis and we are running out of time. Any time soon we'll add the documentation and we'll comment much more the code.
If you have any issue or find any bug please add it to the Project's Issues( https://github.com/UHCalendarTeam/ICalendar/issues) so we'll be able to solve it.
